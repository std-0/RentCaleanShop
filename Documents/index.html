                    <p>ViserMart is a very easy and simple E-Commerce application that has dynamic frontend and backend
                        features. The site is very neat and clean and the process is very easy to use, the user needs to
                        login as a customer to his/her dashboard, and then they are ready to shop there desire products.
                        The admin will accept their payment for an order. On the other hand Admin can add products,
                        manage all Products, Product Variants, Product Categories, Brands, Attributes, Offers and
                        Coupons and many more.</p>

                        summarize the total process of the application here. The script comes with a simple and
                        easy-to-use admin and user panel which leads to use without any coding knowledge.</p>
